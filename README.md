Thanks for the clarification!

Below is a tailored `README.md` file for the **`Bazarya-Model-Training`** repository — focusing on the machine learning pipeline that powers the **Bazarya** price forecast system.

# 🧠 Bazarya-Model-Training

This repository contains the data processing, model training, evaluation, and export pipelines for **Bazarya**, a lightweight market price forecasting and alert system designed for local markets in Ethiopia.

It serves as the **ML backend** for the [Bazarya Flask app](https://github.com/yourusername/bazarya), which provides a web interface for price forecasts, user submissions, and alerts.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To forecast daily prices of agricultural and food products using time series models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM). This repo ensures:

- Clean and structured market price data
- Automated preprocessing and feature engineering
- Reproducible training and evaluation of models
- Export of serialized models (e.g., `.pkl`, `.h5`) for use in production

## 🛠️ Model Training Workflow

1. **Preprocess Data**
    ```bash
    python scripts/preprocess.py
    ```

2. **Train ARIMA Model**
    ```bash
    python scripts/train_arima.py
    ```

3. **(Optional) Train LSTM Model**
    ```bash
    python scripts/train_lstm.py
    ```

4. **Evaluate Model Performance**
    ```bash
    python scripts/evaluate.py
    ```

5. **Export Trained Models**
    - ARIMA → `models/arima_model.pkl`
    - LSTM → `models/lstm_model.h5`

## 📊 Models Used

| Model | Description                           | Use Case                      |
|-------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| ARIMA | AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Avg. | Default for most markets      |
| LSTM  | Recurrent Neural Network (Keras)      | For dense or long-term data   |

> ARIMA is used by default for its low compute demand and interpretability. LSTM is available as a high-performance option when GPU or long sequences are available.

---

## 🔍 Data Format

Input data is expected as:

| date       | market    | product      | price |
|------------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| 2024-06-01 | Addis     | Teff (white) | 5800  |
| 2024-06-01 | Jimma     | Onion        | 2300  |

- `price` should be numeric
- Date must be in `YYYY-MM-DD` format

---

## 🧪 Evaluation Metrics

- RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)

These metrics are logged during training and exported in `logs/`.

---

## 🌍 Planned Enhancements

- ✅ Support for multiple markets per product
- ✅ Support for categorical encodings
- 🔄 Multivariate models (e.g., inflation, weather)
- 🔄 Integration with real-time web scrapers
- 🔄 HuggingFace/DVC pipeline versioning

---

## 🤝 Integration with Bazarya Flask App

Trained models from this repo are loaded in the [Bazarya Web App](https://github.com/yourusername/bazarya) for live price prediction.

Ensure the model file paths in the Flask repo point to exported files from this repo.
